# Cloud Sculptor

My entry for Ludum Dare 35. You can play at https://gamejolt.com/games/cloud-sculptor/141998

Clouds, shapeshifters by excellence, and you, the wind that sculpts them in a never-ending improvisation.

Controls:

WASD to move, mouse to control wind direction, left-click to blow.

Bugs:

- It may take 5 - 10 seconds to load, so please be patient.
- If you see some weird black squares on screen, reload the page, it's just
  a strange bug.
- Some clouds may pop up suddenly, didn't know why.

Thanks for playing :]
